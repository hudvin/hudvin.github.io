## About

Hi, I’m Vadym. I love mountains, rocks, a bit of climbing and mountaineering, hiking, photography, history, and my cat. I’m currently in the middle of moving — no longer at home, but not quite at a new one yet. Occasionally, I write about gadgets, hiking, tech, history, and photography. Still trying to figure out who I’ll be when I grow up.
